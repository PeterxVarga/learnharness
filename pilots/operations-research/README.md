# Operations Research — LearnHarness R1 qualification pilot

**Status:** synthetic oracles and non-executing GLPK contract tests prepared; AI tutoring, PDF grounding and GLPK runtime **not yet qualified**.

**Parent:** amosblomqvist/learnharness tag v0.3.8, commit `3dc88472eea41eed0d5e5f29c2f16f8d063c415b`.
**Pilot branch:** `pilot/operations-research-r1` in PeterxVarga/learnharness.

This is a bounded experiment, **not** a production feature or fork-wide redesign. The existing prober → plan → teach → practice flow remains unchanged.

## Scope and evidence boundaries

- **Public repository contains synthetic examples only.** Do not commit university lecture PDFs, Google Drive copies, exam solutions, personal responses, credentials or unlicensed source passages.
- These deterministic tests prove simple arithmetic/feasibility results, **not** teaching quality, PDF citations, agent correctness or a GLPK integration.
- The current LearnHarness file tools can read from the user's home directory. Do not mistake the app for an OS sandbox. For pilot execution, use an isolated OS account/container with expendable data or prove a narrower access boundary first.
- LLM-provider calls may transmit user-provided text to external providers. Start with synthetic documents only and explicitly cap provider spending.
- Never change `main`, enable unattended paid model runs or merge this work without gates.

## Run the standalone mathematical oracles

```sh
node --test pilots/operations-research/oracles.test.mjs
# The suite is also imported by tests/operations-research-pilot.test.ts,
# which is included in upstream `npm test`.
```

Four source-independent controls:

| ID | Competence | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SYN-PROD | Two-product integer capacity model | Max profit 60 at (4, 4) |
| SYN-SHIP | Two-source/two-destination transport with route cap | Min cost 68; shipments (4, 3, 2, 3) |
| SYN-CONFLICT | Opposing proportional linear inequalities | `4x+4y <=12` plus `x+y>=4` is infeasible |
| SYN-COMPOSITION | Impossible goal detection | `a+b<=6`, `b>=a`, score `6a+4b`: max 30, threshold 31 impossible |

The production and transport cases use exhaustive integer enumeration; infeasibility uses an algebraic certificate or exhaustive bounded score search. These tests don't invoke GLPK.


## GLPK contract R1: prepared, but intentionally not executable

Run the new offline contract suite:

```sh
node --test pilots/operations-research/glpk-contract.test.mjs
```

`renderTrustedMathProg(problem)` only accepts a small, bounded JSON-like linear model with explicitly named variables, objective coefficients and constraints. It **does not** accept arbitrary learner `.mod` source. The generated MathProg uses fixed templates and numeric coefficients; no model-supplied commands or filenames.

`inspectGlpkResult(problem, glpText, solutionText)` is an independent verifier of the intended `--wglp` and `--write` outputs. It maps column indices by symbolic names rather than assuming their order, recomputes objective and constraint feasibility, enforces integrality, and distinguishes proven optimum, merely feasible, infeasible, and unknown. Fake solver outputs in tests are *parsing fixtures*, not real solver evidence. If a live solver stops due to errors or timeouts, its output must never be presented as a certified mathematical result.

A real GLPK execution adapter is **deliberately not wired up**. GNU MathProg supports file output statements, so process spawn with a temp directory is not a sufficient isolation boundary. Before enabling any live execution, require and test a genuinely confined sandbox (filesystem allowlist, network denial, process/time/memory caps), pin the `glpsol` version, and verify its native `--wglp`/`--write` outputs against this parser. Keep the teacher agent read-only until those gates pass.

## Qualification protocol (human in the loop)

1. **Baseline:** pin the version and run `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` and `npm run lint`; retain exit codes and logs. CI is not evidence of Fedora runtime success.
2. **Fedora pilot:** run on loopback using an isolated test account. The upstream AppImage has reported Fedora/FUSE issues. No global package changes or security bypasses.
3. **Beginner tutoring:** assess starting understanding and reasons, not only answers. Verify the next explanation responds to a specific misconception.
4. **Source grounding:** use a non-sensitive synthetic, page-numbered PDF. Verify actual page and quotations; unsupported citations fail.
5. **Adversarial math:** run all four synthetic cases against the teacher. Claiming any optimum for an infeasible case is a hard failure.
6. **Retention:** test a new problem independently on a different day. Correct answers during teaching or graph-node count do not establish durable skill.
7. **Cost/privacy:** record provider/model, tokens, cost, document scope and access; require explicit budget and data approval.

**Hard-stop:** hallucinated optima for infeasible models; fabricated document citations; unapproved file/network access; unexpected exposure of source data.

**GO:** no hard stop, >=80/100 across source grounding (30), mathematics (25), adaptive teaching (20), delayed independent transfer (10), Fedora usability (10), and cost visibility (5).
**CONDITIONAL:** 65–79/100 without hard stop. **NO-GO:** hard stop or <65. These are pilot engineering gates, not research-validated educational scores.

## Bounded next implementation

After baseline, add a separate allowlisted GLPK/MathProg adapter that accepts explicit user-approved synthetic file paths only. Execute `glpsol` without a shell, with fixed time/memory/output limits, and capture statuses: optimal, infeasible, unbounded, error. Test failure modes before allowing an AI to use it. Never grant arbitrary shell access to the teacher.

Keep real student materials and private exam examples out of this public repo.

## Without GitHub Actions / Remote Desktop

Run only the dependency-free mathematical tests using Node.js:

```sh
node pilots/operations-research/verify-offline.mjs
```

This command runs 28 tests (4 reference, 6 GLPK contract, 6 PDF provenance, 12 course opt-in) and produces a machine-readable JSON receipt with source hashes. It can be run on an independent developer computer or offline runner; no GitHub Actions credits, remote desktop, provider API key or `npm install` needed. It does **not** certify the full Next.js app, GLPK runtime, PDF grounding or Fedora installation. The 16 earlier pilot tests were verified with Node 22.16.0; the 12 course tests were checked separately. A fresh full 28/28 offline receipt and upstream integration build are still required for this exact commit.

## PDF source-provenance R1 (source boundary, not factual accuracy)

The real `pdf-reader.ts` now records only structured page ids from the PDF parser, only *shown* search hits (max 40), and only pages actually rendered. It no longer infers evidence from requests such as `pdf_extract pages=all`. A truncated final extracted page cannot be cited unless re-read. The model's final brief must cite `(p. N)` references that match consulted pages; after one corrective retry a bad brief fails closed. The list `Pages consulted:` is rewritten from observed provenance, never trusted from the model. Existing teaching flow is preserved; course PDFs are not committed.

Six pure, offline citation tests can run without dependencies. Three additional fake-engine integration regression tests are included in `tests/pdf-reader.test.ts`, but **still require the complete upstream dependencies** and have not been executed in this environment. The offline verifier now checks **16 tests** and requires Node 22+ for built-in TypeScript stripping.

**Limit:** Citation membership does NOT prove the mathematical claim is present on that page, that the text was interpreted correctly, or that the instructor's answer is valid. This will need an evidence-level verification phase plus GLPK validation.


## Hungarian course pilot R1 — strictly opt-in

The prober and teacher receive the course-specific context ONLY if the **first user message** of a new learning session begins exactly with:

```text
/course operations-research-hu-r1
```

Print a safe starter message with:

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types pilots/operations-research/start-course.mjs
```

Copy that message into a **new teaching session** in LearnHarness. The user still chooses a provider/key as normal; the course does not trigger any model calls or file access merely from code installation. It uses the upstream prober -> teacher flow, not a parallel tutor. Ordinary chats and standalone practice remain unchanged.

The eight-unit provisional map covers basic LP modelling, feasibility, graphical reasoning, transport, MathProg sets/parameters, simplex, and fresh timed tasks. It is not a verified complete syllabus and is not evidence of learner mastery. Private lesson PDFs are never included in the public repository; the user must separately permit any local source access and account for third-party model transmission. The teacher must not claim real GLPK execution.

Unit tests validate the dependency DAG, exact first-message activation and refusal of unrelated/quoted triggers. They are bundled into the **28-test offline verifier** and imported into upstream `npm test`.

**Not yet qualified:** The full LearnHarness install/build, live provider sessions, end-to-end Hungarian learning quality, PDF semantic entailment, isolated GLPK runtime, and Fedora app experience. Draft PR remains unmerged.
